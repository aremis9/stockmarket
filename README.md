# stockmarket
Virtual stock market brokerage.

Project from Harvard's CS50

- Install requirements.txt
- ```export FLASK_APP=application.py```
- Get API key from [IEX](https://iexcloud.io/)
- ```export API_KEY=your-api-key```
- ```flask run```

I had fun doing this project so I will remake this with **Django** soon!
